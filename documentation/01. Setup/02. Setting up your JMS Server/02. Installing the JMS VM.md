Before we can do any other setup, we need to install the JMS VM.

# 1. Download the Ubuntu 22.04 LTS ISO image
First, download the Ubuntu ISO from here: https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop

# 2. Upload the Ubuntu ISO to Proxmox

# 4. Start the VM and install Ubuntu
Hit the "start" button to start the VM, then open "Console" to be greeted with a visual session into your VM.

Follow the prompts to install Ubuntu according to your preferences. A few guidelines:
- Normal Installation
- Download Updates while installing Ubuntu
- Erase disk and install Ubuntu
- Select the timezone of your event
- Choose a secure set of creds known by the FTA only. We recommend the username 'fta' and the computer name "jms.frc-field.local"
	- Images provisioned by us usually have the default password "jmsR0cks"
