To setup the JMS network, follow the below steps. 

**Note: Ensure you have completed the [[Setting up the Core Switch]] instructions first!**

# 1. Create VLAN Trunk

![[03.1.1.png]]

Substitute `enp2s0` for your second (non-WAN) network interface.

# 2. Create Admin network
Create a new interface, this time with the following settings:
- Name: vmbr100
- IPv4: 10.0.100.10/24
- VLAN aware: false
- Bridge ports: vmbr9999.100

# 3. Connect to the hypervisor on VLAN 100
Connect an ethernet cable to the Core Switch on any ADMIN port. Open a new browser window and navigate to [https://10.0.100.10:8006] and login to Proxmox. From now on, this is how we will access the hypervisor.

# 4. Configure WAN to be DHCP
Open a console on your hypervisor machine (On the left pane, Datacenter > jms-hypervisor then "Shell").

Edit the interfaces with `nano /etc/network/interfaces` and change vmbr0 to the following
```
auto vmbr0
iface vmbr0 inet dhcp
		bridge-ports <interface>    # Replace <interface> with your interface, this should remain unchanged
		bridge-stp off
		bridge-fd 0
	
```

Save the file and run `systemctl restart networking` to reload the network configuration.

*Tip: If you ever need to know the WAN IP of the hypervisor, you can run `ip addr show dev vmbr0`. You can do this from the headless console if you somehow become locked out of your box.*

# 5. Passthrough Bridge Interface to the JMS VM
In your VM, add a new network interface.

**Make sure Firewall is disabled**
*Note: you may also need to disable the firewall for the WAN interface - give it a try if you're having problems connecting to the internet.*

# 6. Configure Netplan in the JMS VM
Inside of the JMS VM, we need to configure netplan to use the appropriate VLANs so that JMS can see them. 

To start, do `cd /etc/netplan`. Also take note of your interfaces with `ip addr show` - the one with the IP address is your WAN, and the other is the VLAN trunk.

## 6.1 Remove the default NetworkManager file
Remove the initial netplan configuration, `rm 01-network-manager-all.yaml`

## 6.2 Populate a new netplan file
Create a new file `01-jms.yaml` and populate it with the following:
```yml
network:
  version: 2
  renderer: networkd
  ethernets:
    enp6s18:
      dhcp4: true
    enp6s19: {}
  vlans:
    admin:
      id: 100
      link: enp6s19
      addresses: [10.0.100.1/24, 10.0.100.5/24]
    blue1:
      id: 10
      link: enp6s19
    blue2:
      id: 20
      link: enp6s19
    blue3:
      id: 30
      link: enp6s19
    red1:
      id: 40
      link: enp6s19
    red2:
      id: 50
      link: enp6s19
    red3:
      id: 60
      link: enp6s19
    imaging:
      id: 99
      link: enp6s19
```

# 7. Disable UFW in the JMS VM
JMS manages it's own firewall, so we're going to disable ufw. 
```
sudo ufw disable
```

# 8. Verify you can reach the JMS Server
Try and ping 10.0.100.5 while plugged into one of the ADMIN ports. If you get a ping back, you've succeeded!
