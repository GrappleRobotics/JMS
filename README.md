JMS
===
Another alternative Field Management System for the FIRST Robotics Competition.

JMS is based heavily off the official FRC FMS, as well as Cheesy-Arena. JMS differs in that the bulk of the network operations are performed onboard the JMS server itself, requiring minimal external and increasing the reliability of the system.

For those early-birds, do NOT install this on your personal machine. JMS WILL override your network, dhcp, and firewall settings. JMS is designed to be run on a Ubuntu Server 20.04 instance (either physical or in a VM).

More information coming soon.
